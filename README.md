# Team-Profile-Generator ðŸ‘‹

## User Story

As a manager, I want to create an application that generates profile information for each of my employees.
It should contain the following information:
Name, ID, Email, Office Number, Github and School.

## Description
* The app was built with node command line and inquirer modules.
* Testing is available.

## Usage

The application will display a series of input requests where the user will enter desired information.
After all the profiles have been generated, a card will be displayed in HTML for each one of them.

## Testing

To test the app, simply enter npm test, and a Jest test will be initiated.
